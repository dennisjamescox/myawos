There are multiple versions of the code - the baseline is tagged baseline07. If you grab that its a basic working set of the code. 
Johann has made some massive improvements - removing the Arduino, using a optrelay, multiple clicker usage, computer generated voice, etc. 

Its best if you get a basic version up first then start modifying with all the different variants aviable. 

First step - get yourself a Raspberry Pi 4, Ardunio Uno, Davis Weather Station or Ecowitt (not nearly as good as the Davis IMHO) and an aviation radio.
The wiring is quite simple - just contact me if you need help.
